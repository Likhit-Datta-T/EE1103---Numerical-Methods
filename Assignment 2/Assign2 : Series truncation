## Assign2: Series truncation

The objectives of this assignment are

1.  Understand how series truncation causes errors

2.  Learn to use the [math
    > library](https://courses.iitm.ac.in/mod/url/view.php?id=43361)
    > (include math.h and link the library during compilation)

3.  Understand the use of data types (int, float, double) and correctly
    > convert between them using ceil() or floor()

4.  Write and call a function to calculate the factorial of an integer

Upload a c-program that will take two arguments as input,

1.  int for the number to terms in the truncated series for sin(x) and

2.  float for the value of x

Your program should output only two %.3f values (separated by a comma)

1.  The estimated value of sin(x) using the truncated series

2.  The error between the estimated value and the true value (from the
    > [math
    > library](https://courses.iitm.ac.in/mod/url/view.php?id=43361)
    > function sin())
